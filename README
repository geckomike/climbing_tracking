programme. Here is a breakdown of the important files.

hold_tracking.py = The main script 
hold_detection.ipynb = A Jupyter notebook file for testing individual
components

hold_footage_2.mov = The test footage captured to perform tracking on.

data/raw_video = A folder containing captured footage in raw camera format

yolov5 = The model and all its components.

data = Images and labels used to train the model on climbing holds. Currently
the model is only trained on black climbing holds with green spots. Eventually
other hold colours will be added.
